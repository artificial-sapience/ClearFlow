# ClearFlow Development Plan

## Current Branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Completed This Session âœ…
- âœ… Renamed portfolio example "agents" â†’ "specialists" (Workflow pattern, not Agent pattern)
- âœ… Cleaned up excessive disclaimers across portfolio example
- âœ… Updated README.md:
  - Removed quickstart section (too complex, not "Hello World" style)
  - Added Examples section with table
  - Removed inaccurate minimalism claims (~250 lines)
  - Fixed redundant "state transformations" wording
  - Added new badges (Downloads, Type: Pyright, Ruff)
- âœ… All quality checks passing (100% coverage, type safety, linting)

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Consider Creating Simple Examples
- [ ] Evaluate if we need ultra-simple quickstart example
- [ ] Consider creating examples/qa_pipeline/ from saved quickstart code
- [ ] Plan RAG example implementation (full offline + online stages)

### 2. Final PR Preparation ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Create detailed PR description including:
  - Type transformation support  
  - Flow builder validation (reachability & duplicate routes)
  - Custom linters for mission-critical compliance
  - Portfolio example refactoring (agents â†’ specialists)
  - README improvements and badge additions
- [ ] Final quality-check.sh run
- [ ] Submit PR for review

## Future Considerations
- Add timeout and max iterations support to flow execution
- Create more examples following different design patterns (Agent, RAG, Map-Reduce)
- Consider documentation site when project grows
