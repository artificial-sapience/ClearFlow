# ClearFlow Development Plan

## Current Branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Next Priority: Design Pattern Analysis 🎯

### 1. Agent Design Pattern Review
- [ ] Analyze if portfolio example "agents" follow the Agent design pattern
- [ ] Review https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/agent.html
- [ ] Determine if we should rename "agents" to more appropriate term
- [ ] Update terminology if needed based on actual design pattern used

### 2. Examples Review 🛡️
- [ ] Review chat example for similar issues
- [ ] Verify all examples follow best practices
- [ ] Ensure consistent design patterns across examples

### 3. Final Code Review 🔍
- [ ] Review all type transformations for correctness
- [ ] Verify Node protocol implementation is solid
- [ ] Ensure documentation matches implementation

### 4. PR Preparation 📋
- [ ] Final quality-check.sh run across entire codebase
- [ ] Create detailed PR description including:
  - Type transformation support  
  - Flow builder validation (reachability & duplicate routes)
  - Custom linters for mission-critical compliance
  - Documentation improvements
  - Portfolio example reorganization and bug fixes
- [ ] Submit PR for review
