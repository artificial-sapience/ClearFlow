# ClearFlow Message-Driven Architecture Implementation Plan

## Current Sprint: Finalization and API Design

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Decision Required: Public API Design

**Issue**: Message-based API is not exported in `clearflow.__init__.py` but tests import directly from submodules.

**Current State**:
- `clearflow.__init__.py` only exports: `Node`, `NodeResult`, `flow` (original string-based API)
- Tests import from: `clearflow.message_flow`, `clearflow.message_node`, `clearflow.observer`, etc.
- This violates "test only through public API" principle

**Decision Required**:
1. **Make message API public**: Add to `__init__.py` `__all__` exports
2. **Keep message API internal**: Fix tests to not import from submodules

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks (Priority Order)

1. **Decide Message API Publicity** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - [ ] Determine if message API should be public or internal
   - [ ] If public: Add exports to `clearflow.__init__.py` `__all__`
   - [ ] If internal: Refactor tests to use only public API or document as implementation tests

2. **Fix Linting Issues** (Priority: HIGH)
   - [x] Architecture compliance (COMPLETED)
   - [x] Immutability compliance (COMPLETED) 
   - [x] Test suite compliance (COMPLETED)
   - [ ] 71 linting errors found by quality check (need fixing)
     - Unused imports in test files
     - Missing docstring returns
     - Method could be function warnings
     - Exception handling issues

3. **Complete Test Coverage** (Priority: HIGH)  
   - [x] All 85 tests pass (COMPLETED)
   - [x] 98.86% coverage achieved (COMPLETED)
   - [ ] Fix 2 uncovered lines in `message_node.py` for 100%

4. **Final Quality Validation** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - [ ] Complete `./quality-check.sh` with all standards passing
   - [ ] Document any approved suppressions with justifications
   - [ ] Verify examples work with new API

## Completed Work âœ…

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Fixed Flow Builder Routing Bug** - Implemented hybrid API with `from_node()` method
2. **Created Hybrid API** - Explicit producer specification while maintaining fluent chaining
3. **Updated Linter** - Allow same-module private access (Pythonic convention)
4. **Updated All Tests** - Now use hybrid API with explicit routing
5. **High Test Coverage** - Achieved 98.86% coverage (237 lines, only 2 uncovered)

### Architecture Improvements
- **Hybrid API Pattern**: 
  ```python
  message_flow("example", start)
      .from_node(start)
      .route(SuccessMessage, processor)  
      .route(ErrorMessage, handler)
      .from_node(processor)
      .route(ProcessedMessage, finalizer)
  ```
- **Type Safety**: Full type tracking through the builder chain
- **Linter Compliance**: Fixed architecture linter for Pythonic same-module access

## Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Hybrid API Over Pure Inference** - Explicit `from_node()` for clarity and type safety
2. **Same-Module Private Access** - Updated linter to follow Python conventions  
3. **Method Naming in Private Classes** - Removed redundant underscores (`add_route` vs `_add_route`)
4. **Builder Context Pattern** - `_MessageFlowBuilderContext` for fluent chaining

## Files Recently Modified

### Core Implementation 
- `clearflow/message_flow.py` - Implemented hybrid API with context pattern
- `linters/check-architecture-compliance.py` - Fixed same-module access rules

### Tests Updated
- `tests/test_message_flow.py` - All tests now use `from_node()` pattern
- `tests/test_observer.py` - Updated flows to use hybrid API

### Status: 85/85 tests passing, 98.86% coverage
