# Portfolio Analysis Message-Driven Example: Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the portfolio_analysis_message_driven example from a broken random-logic simulation into a production-quality, event-driven system with real LLM intelligence using DSPy and OpenAI.

## CRITICAL QUALITY REQUIREMENT

**Every phase MUST achieve 100% quality compliance before proceeding to the next phase.**
- Run `./quality-check.sh examples/portfolio_analysis_message_driven/` after EVERY file change
- Fix ALL violations immediately - no accumulation of tech debt
- NO suppressions without explicit user approval
- Each phase ends with verified 100% quality check pass

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

### Phase 3: Final Integration and Polish

**PREREQUISITE**: Phase 2 (DSPy integration) complete ✅

#### Task 3.1: Integration Testing
- [ ] Create test script that runs the complete flow
- [ ] Verify all nodes work together
- [ ] Test error paths
- [ ] **Quality Gate**: Ensure test script passes quality checks

#### Task 3.2: Documentation
- [ ] Create README.md for the example
- [ ] Document setup instructions
- [ ] Include example output
- [ ] **Quality Gate**: Run quality check on README

#### Task 3.3: Final Quality Verification
- [ ] Run `./quality-check.sh examples/portfolio_analysis_message_driven/`
- [ ] Verify ZERO violations
- [ ] Confirm all linters pass (architecture, immutability, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure pyright strict mode passes

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

**PREREQUISITE**: Phase 3 must pass all quality checks

#### Task 4.1: Create Integration Test
- [ ] Write `test_integration.py` with real OpenAI calls
- [ ] Test complete flow from start to decision
- [ ] Verify each node produces expected event types
- [ ] Test error paths (API failures, invalid data)

#### Task 4.2: Create Example Runner
- [ ] Verify `main.py` works with realistic market data
- [ ] Test command-line argument parsing
- [ ] Include timing and performance metrics
- [ ] Add visual output formatting

#### Task 4.3: Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Document DSPy integration approach
- [ ] Provide setup instructions for OpenAI API
- [ ] Include example output from real run

### Phase 5: Observability Implementation (Future)

**PREREQUISITE**: Core functionality complete and tested

#### Task 5.1: Implement ClearFlow Observers
- [ ] Create observers for each message type
- [ ] Track LLM calls and responses
- [ ] Monitor flow execution time
- [ ] Capture errors and retries

#### Task 5.2: MLflow Integration
- [ ] Evaluate MLflow for comprehensive tracking
- [ ] Implement LLM call tracking
- [ ] Set up experiment tracking
- [ ] Configure metrics collection
- [ ] Enable model versioning

#### Task 5.3: Observability Testing
- [ ] Test observer pattern doesn't affect flow
- [ ] Verify all messages are captured
- [ ] Ensure MLflow integration works
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

## Session Progress Tracking

### Session 1 (Completed)
- ✅ Analyzed architecture issues
- ✅ Copied DSPy integration files
- ✅ Created comprehensive plan
- ✅ Completed Phase 1 (Event-driven refactor)

### Session 2 (Completed)
- ✅ Fixed immutability violations in messages
- ✅ Configured DSPy in main.py
- ✅ Implemented all 5 nodes with DSPy
- ✅ Achieved clean architecture (no console logging)
- ✅ Passed Phase 2 quality gates

### Session 3 (Next)
- [ ] Complete Phase 3 (Integration and polish)
- [ ] Begin Phase 4 (Testing and validation)

## Observability Strategy

### Current State
- ClearFlow has `Observer` pattern implementation in `clearflow/observer.py`
- Observers can monitor message flows without affecting routing
- **DO NOT add console logging/print statements in nodes**

### Implementation Guidelines
- Nodes should focus purely on business logic
- No print statements or console logging in node implementations
- Return structured data in events for observability
- Observers will handle all logging/tracking concerns

## Quality Compliance Checklist

For EVERY file change:
1. ✅ No `# noqa` comments without approval
2. ✅ No `# type: ignore` comments without approval
3. ✅ All functions have "Returns:" sections in docstrings
4. ✅ All exceptions are specific (no bare `except:`)
5. ✅ All imports are absolute
6. ✅ All `__all__` lists are sorted
7. ✅ Code complexity is Grade A
8. ✅ No dead code detected
9. ✅ Pyright strict mode passes

## Success Criteria

1. **Architecture**: Pure event-driven with single initiating command ✅
2. **LLM Integration**: Real DSPy/OpenAI calls, no random simulation ✅
3. **Quality**: Zero violations from `./quality-check.sh` (In Progress)
4. **Functionality**: Complete flow executes with actual LLM responses (Ready to test)
5. **Maintainability**: Clear, simple code following ClearFlow patterns ✅

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Always check this plan first for context
- Run `./quality-check.sh` after EVERY file change
- Fix violations immediately - don't accumulate
- Test with real OpenAI API, not mocks
- Maintain event-driven philosophy throughout
- Keep messages focused (no god-objects)
- Document all design decisions in code
