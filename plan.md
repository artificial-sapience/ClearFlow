# ClearFlow Implementation Plan

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Linters Quality Compliance
**Status**: 95% complete  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

#### Remaining:
- Final verification that all linters pass 100% quality checks
- Possibly a few minor style/formatting issues to resolve

### Phase 2: Quality Check Script Improvements (Optional)
**Status**: Not started
**Priority**: LOW

#### Consider for future:
- Xenon output: Show which specific functions exceed complexity
- Vulture output: Better formatting for dead code reporting
- Add better error messages for all tools
