Your context window is almost full. Therefore we must start a new concrete session. Please think deeper about completing the following tasks:

1. Update plan.md to ensure it is complete and correct.
    - Add any missing tasks ensuring the order of tasks is optimal.
    - Update the status of any tasks that have changed.
    - Delete any sections that are 100% complete so that we continuously reduce the file size.

2. Capture the full context of this concrete session and then overwrite session-context.md to capture it so we can seamlessly start a new concrete session as if we never left this one. Ensure that session-context.md references plan.md as needed instead of duplicating its content.

3. Finally, generate a prompt I should use to initiate our next concrete session and save it to continue-session-prompt.md , ensuring that continue-session-prompt.md references session-context.md as needed instead of duplicating its content.
