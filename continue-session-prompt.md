Please continue our work on ClearFlow. We just completed the message-driven architecture migration with both examples now production-ready and quality-compliant.

**Status**: Both `portfolio_analysis_message_driven` and `rag_message_driven` examples are complete with ZERO quality violations across the entire codebase. Both examples are ready for production API testing.

**Current Branch**: message-driven

**Major Achievements This Session**:
1. **Fixed DSPy field access errors** in portfolio_analysis_message_driven (prediction.report → prediction.compliance_review, prediction.decision → prediction.trading_decision)
2. **Complete RAG rewrite** - rag_message_driven now uses FAISS, numpy arrays, and production RAG practices matching examples/rag/
3. **Model standardization** - All examples now use gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07
4. **100% quality compliance** maintained across entire codebase

**Next Priority**: Execute Task 1 from plan.md - Production API testing of both examples with real OpenAI API calls to validate functionality, performance, and error handling.

Please review the current plan.md and session-context.md, then proceed with the next priority task.
