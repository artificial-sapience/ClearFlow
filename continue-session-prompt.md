# Continue ClearFlow Session

Please continue the ClearFlow session from where we left off.

## Context
See **session-context.md** for full session context and accomplishments.
See **plan.md** for complete task list.

## Primary Task
**Complete linters/ quality compliance to achieve 100%**

We've made excellent progress refactoring the linters from complexity 27 down to 9, fixing type annotations, and resolving most linting issues. The linters now pass all custom compliance checks (architecture, immutability, test-suite).

## Immediate Focus
1. Run `./quality-check.sh linters` to see current status
2. Fix any remaining minor issues (likely just formatting or style)
3. Verify 100% compliance achieved with zero suppressions
4. Confirm all quality checks pass

## Success Criteria
- `./quality-check.sh linters` must pass 100%
- Zero suppressions (no noqa, type: ignore, pragma, etc.)
- All functions must maintain Grade A complexity (â‰¤7 ideally)
- Maintain the improvements we've made

## Background
- Linters are critical infrastructure requiring same quality as production code
- We've systematically refactored complex functions using helper extraction
- Type safety has been improved with explicit annotations
- The code is now much more maintainable

Please start by running the quality check to see the exact current state, then address any remaining issues to achieve 100% compliance.
