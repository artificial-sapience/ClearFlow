# Continue ClearFlow Session

Please continue working on the ClearFlow project. We're on the `support-state-type-transformations` branch.

## Immediate Task
Add targeted type ignores for DSPy dynamic attributes while preserving type safety for Pydantic models:

1. The portfolio example now shows 48 type errors after removing overly broad suppressions (this is good progress!)
2. Need to add targeted `# type: ignore` comments specifically for DSPy's dynamic `_predict` attributes and return types  
3. **DO NOT** add broad file-level suppressions - use line-specific ignores only for DSPy dynamic behavior
4. Preserve type checking for all Pydantic model field access to catch bugs like the `market_regime` vs `market_trend` issue
5. Run quality checks to ensure type checking works properly

## Context
We successfully enhanced AI output display and fixed a critical runtime bug that was hidden by overly broad type suppressions. The type checking now works correctly with DSPy stubs, showing legitimate errors that need targeted handling.

See **session-context.md** for complete session history and **plan.md** for detailed remaining tasks.

## Key Files
- `examples/portfolio_analysis/nodes.py` - needs targeted type ignores for DSPy  
- `typings/dspy/` - type stubs are installed and configured
- `pyproject.toml` - configured to use type stubs

## Success Criteria
- Type checking shows minimal errors (only unavoidable DSPy dynamic behavior)
- All quality checks pass including pyright/mypy
- Pydantic model field access remains fully type-checked
- Portfolio example runs without errors
