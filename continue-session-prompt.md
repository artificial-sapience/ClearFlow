# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue working on the ClearFlow project.

## Context
- Review `session-context.md` for complete session history and accomplishments
- Review `plan.md` for current priorities and task list
- We're on branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Next Priority

Based on `plan.md`, the immediate priorities are:

1. **Consider Simple Examples** - Evaluate if we need an ultra-simple quickstart or additional examples
2. **Prepare PR** - Create detailed PR description and submit for review

## Key Points to Remember

- Portfolio example now uses "specialists" (not "agents") - it follows the Workflow pattern
- README has been significantly cleaned up - no quickstart, cleaner philosophy
- ClearFlow emphasizes **correctness and safety**, not minimalism
- All quality checks are passing

Please pick up where we left off and continue with the tasks in `plan.md`.
