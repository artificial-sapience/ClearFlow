# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue working on the ClearFlow project.

## Context
- Review `session-context.md` for complete session history and accomplishments
- Review `plan.md` for current priorities and task list
- We're on branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Critical Priority ðŸš¨

**Fix the dependency conflict** discovered in the last session:
- `dspy>=3.0.0` requires `rich>=13.7.1`
- `semgrep>=1.134.0` requires `rich>=13.5.2,<13.6.dev0`

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Update ALL dependencies to latest stable versions** (2025 versions)
   - Check PyPI for latest stable releases
   - Update version constraints in pyproject.toml
   - Resolve the rich version conflict
   - Test that everything still works

2. **Complete RAG example quality checks**
   - Fix any remaining type errors
   - Ensure it passes `./quality-check.sh examples/rag`

3. **Prepare for PR submission**
   - See plan.md for full PR checklist

## Key Context
- We switched all examples to use pyproject.toml (no more requirements.txt)
- All build systems now use hatchling (not setuptools)
- Root pyproject.toml has `[project.optional-dependencies.examples]`
- Most packages have built-in types (NumPy, OpenAI, dotenv)

Please start by checking and updating all dependencies to their latest stable versions.
