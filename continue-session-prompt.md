# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue our work on implementing the message-driven architecture for ClearFlow. 

## Context
Read `session-context.md` for full context of our previous session's work on the message-driven architecture design and implementation.

## Current Status
We have successfully designed and implemented the core message-driven architecture modules but need to complete the implementation. Review `plan.md` for the detailed task breakdown and current status.

## Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix Quality Issues (30 minutes)
The core modules pass architecture and immutability checks but have remaining linting issues:
- Run `./quality-check.sh message.py message_node.py message_flow.py observer.py` 
- Fix the 29 remaining whitespace/documentation linting issues (mostly auto-fixable with `ruff format`)
- Address the RUF006 warning in `observer.py` about storing `asyncio.create_task` reference
- Ensure all modules pass complete quality checks

### 2. Create Basic Tests (2 hours)
Create comprehensive tests for the new message-driven system:
- Message creation, causality tracking, and metadata
- Node processing with type safety validation
- Flow execution and routing behavior
- Observer pattern with error isolation
- Integration tests for the complete system

### 3. Build Working Examples (3 hours) 
Create concrete examples that demonstrate the AI orchestration capabilities:
- Simple message flow showing Commands vs Events
- AI decision-making example (agent choosing between different strategies)
- Observable flow with logging and metrics collection
- Port the existing RAG example to use the new message-driven architecture

## Key Implementation Files
- `message.py` - Message, Event, Command base classes
- `message_node.py` - Node[TMessageIn, TMessageOut] implementation  
- `message_flow.py` - MessageFlow and MessageFlowBuilder
- `observer.py` - Observer pattern and ObservableFlow wrapper

## Success Criteria
- All quality checks pass without violations
- Basic tests provide coverage for core functionality  
- Working examples demonstrate AI orchestration capabilities
- Code maintains ClearFlow's zero-dependency, explicit-behavior philosophy

## Next Phase
After completing these tasks, we'll move to Phase 2 (examples and integration) and Phase 3 (validation and polish) as outlined in `plan.md`.

Please start by running the quality check and fixing any remaining issues, then proceed with creating the test suite.
