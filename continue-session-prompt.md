Please continue our ClearFlow message_flow API redesign.

**Context**: See session-context.md for full details. We discovered a critical UX flaw in the current `from_node()` API and designed a solution to return to explicit source nodes like the original flow API.

**Current Status**:
- Comprehensive plan ready in plan.md
- chat_message_driven partially refactored but blocked by API limitations
- Ready to execute Phase 1: Core API Redesign

**Critical Requirements**:
- The message_flow API must feel IDENTICAL to the flow API
- Only changes: message types instead of state, message types instead of string outcomes
- MAINTAIN single termination, orphan detection, all validations from flow API
- Every task must pass quality checks 100% before proceeding

**Next Task**:
Execute Phase 1, Task 1.1 from plan.md - Update message_flow.py core classes to use explicit source nodes: `.route(from_node, message_type, to_node)`

Please review plan.md and session-context.md, then begin implementation.
