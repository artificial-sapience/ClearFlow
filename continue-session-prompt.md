# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue implementing the ClearFlow improvements to achieve 100% quality check pass.

## Context Files to Review
1. **session-context.md** - Complete summary of accomplishments and current state
2. **plan.md** - Detailed tasks in priority order

## Immediate Priority: Fix _Flow.exec() Complexity
The core library is nearly perfect, but `_Flow.exec()` has complexity rank B (needs A).

## Your Tasks (in order)
1. **Simplify _FlowBuilder design**
   - Keep OOP pattern but reduce lines of code
   - Remove redundant type annotations
   - Maintain the clean `.route().build()` API

2. **Fix _Flow.exec() complexity**
   - Currently rank B according to Xenon
   - Refactor the execution loop
   - Extract complex conditions into helper methods
   - Must maintain 100% test coverage

3. **Update tests to new API**
   - Change from `Flow[T]("name").start_with(node)` to `flow("name", node)`
   - Start with test_flow.py, then test_real_world_scenarios.py
   - Replace all `dict[str, object]` with proper educational types

4. **Run quality check after each major change**
   - Use: `./quality-check.sh clearflow/` for core library
   - Use: `./quality-check.sh` for full project
   - Goal: All tools pass with 0 violations

## Key Context
- We replaced the Flow class with a simpler flow() function
- The quality-check.sh script now properly respects argument scope
- Architecture linter supports multi-line suppressions
- Core library passes everything except complexity check

## Success Criteria
✅ _Flow.exec() achieves complexity rank A
✅ All tests updated to new API with proper types
✅ 100% test coverage maintained
✅ 0 violations in quality check

Start by reviewing the context files, then tackle the _Flow.exec() complexity issue.
