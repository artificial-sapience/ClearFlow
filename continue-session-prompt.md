# Continue ClearFlow Session

Please continue the ClearFlow quality compliance work from where we left off.

## Context
- See **session-context.md** for full session history and accomplishments
- See **plan.md** for remaining tasks

## Primary Task
**Fix examples/ directory to achieve 100% quality compliance**

We've successfully achieved 100% compliance for:
- ✅ clearflow/ (production code)
- ✅ tests/ (test suite)
- ✅ linters/ (infrastructure)

Now we need to ensure examples/ demonstrates best practices with 100% compliance.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Run `./quality-check.sh examples` to assess current state
2. Fix any issues found (likely linting, types, formatting)
3. Ensure examples follow ClearFlow best practices
4. Verify 100% compliance achieved

## Success Criteria
- All examples must pass quality checks
- Examples should demonstrate proper ClearFlow patterns
- No suppressions (noqa, type: ignore) unless absolutely necessary
- Code should be educational and clear

## Background
The examples directory contains demonstration code that users will learn from. It's critical these examples show best practices and pass all quality checks to maintain trust and provide good patterns for users to follow.

Please start by running the quality check on examples/ to see what needs to be fixed.
