# Continue Session: Final Type Safety Polish

Please continue working on the ClearFlow quality improvements.

## Context
See `session-context.md` for complete background. We've successfully fixed major type safety issues and design problems in the message-driven architecture, reducing pyright errors from 78 to just 2.

## Current State
- **88/88 tests passing** ✅
- **100% coverage** ✅  
- **Architecture compliance** ✅
- **2 pyright errors remain** in test files

## Immediate Task

Fix the last 2 pyright errors in `tests/test_message_flow.py`:
- Line 162: `end(ErrorEvent)` type mismatch
- Line 209: `end(ErrorEvent)` type mismatch

These occur where we intentionally create invalid flows for testing error conditions. The type ignores need to be placed correctly to suppress these specific errors.

## Expected Outcome

After fixing these:
- Run `uv run pyright tests/` - should show 0 errors
- All 88 tests should still pass
- Coverage should remain at 100%

## Note
These are low priority since the tests work correctly. The errors are in test code where we're intentionally testing invalid configurations. However, cleaning them up would achieve perfect type safety across the entire codebase.

See `plan.md` for any additional tasks.
