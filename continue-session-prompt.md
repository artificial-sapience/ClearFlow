# Continue ClearFlow Session

Please continue working on ClearFlow improvements.

## Context
- Review **session-context.md** for the major builder pattern redesign we completed
- Review **plan.md** for remaining tasks

## Critical Issue to Fix First

The interrogate tool is failing and blocking quality checks:

```bash
uv run interrogate clearflow/ --quiet --fail-under 100
# Returns exit code 1
```

This prevents quality-check.sh from completing. Fix missing docstrings immediately.

## Then Update Tests to New API

We completely redesigned the builder pattern:
- Old: `Flow[T]("name").start_with(node).route(...).route(..., None).build()`  
- New: `flow("name", node).route(...).end(final_node, "outcome")`

All test files need updating to this new pattern.

## Key Achievement from Last Session

We solved the type tracking problem! The termination node's output type IS the flow's output type. The new `end()` method captures this and returns the built flow directly with proper types: `Node[TStartIn, TTermOut]`.

## Success Metrics
1. `./quality-check.sh clearflow/` completes successfully
2. All tests pass with new API
3. 100% test coverage maintained

Start by fixing the interrogate issue to unblock quality checks.
