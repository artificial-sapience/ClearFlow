# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue working on the ClearFlow project.

## Context

- Review `@session-context.md` for complete session history and accomplishments
- Review `@plan.md` for current priorities and task list
- We're on branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Critical Issues to Fix

We discovered two major bugs in the portfolio analysis example that need immediate attention:

1. **Market Sentiment Bug**: When user selects "Normal market conditions", the code randomly chooses between bullish/bearish/neutral instead of being consistent. Fix in `market_data.py:147`.

2. **LLM Hallucination Bug**: Portfolio Manager is outputting real ETF tickers (QQQ, VOO, VXUS, etc.) instead of using the provided fictional tickers (TECH-01, FIN-01, etc.).

   **Solution Approach**:
   - Update DSPy signatures to explicitly constrain: "You MUST ONLY use symbols from the provided market data"
   - Pass available symbols explicitly to each agent
   - Add to PortfolioManagerSignature: "Your allocation changes must ONLY reference these symbols: {symbols}"
   - Similar constraints for all agents that reference tickers
   - Add validation in Pydantic models to reject unknown symbols
   - Consider passing symbol list as part of state or signature context

## First Actions

1. Check git status to confirm branch and changes
2. Fix the market sentiment randomization bug
3. Fix the LLM hallucination issue with proper constraints
4. Test all three scenarios work correctly
5. Run `./quality-check.sh` to ensure all standards met

## Session Goals

1. Fix both critical bugs in portfolio example
2. Test all three scenarios (normal, bullish, volatile) to ensure consistency
3. Review other examples for similar issues
4. Complete final code review
5. Prepare for PR submission (but don't submit yet)

## Quality Requirements

- Maintain 100% test coverage
- All quality checks must pass
- No unapproved linter suppressions
- Follow the mission-critical standards in CLAUDE.md

Let's start by fixing the portfolio example bugs, beginning with the market sentiment issue in `market_data.py`.
