# Continue Session: Test and Polish Portfolio Example

## Your Task

Continue implementing the portfolio_analysis_message_driven example by completing Phase 3 (Integration and Polish) and beginning Phase 4 (Testing and Validation).

## Context
- **Session context**: See session-context.md for what was accomplished
- **Remaining tasks**: See plan.md for Phase 3 and Phase 4 tasks
- **Branch**: message-driven

## Current State
- ✅ Phase 1 complete: Pure event-driven architecture
- ✅ Phase 2 complete: All 5 nodes implemented with DSPy/LLM integration
- Ready to test with real OpenAI API

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test the Current Implementation
First, verify the example works end-to-end:
```bash
cd examples/portfolio_analysis_message_driven
cp .env.example .env
# Add OpenAI API key to .env
python main.py
```

### 2. Begin Phase 3: Integration and Polish
- Task 3.1: Create integration test script
- Task 3.2: Create README.md documentation
- Task 3.3: Final quality verification

## Important Notes
1. **NO console logging in nodes** - observability is handled separately
2. Run `./quality-check.sh` after every change
3. Maintain pure event-driven architecture
4. Test with real OpenAI API, not mocks

## Start Command
Please begin by testing the current implementation with a real OpenAI API key to verify all nodes work correctly with LLM intelligence, then proceed with Phase 3 tasks from plan.md.
