# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue working on the ClearFlow project.

## Context
- Review `@session-context.md` for complete session history and accomplishments
- Review `@plan.md` for current priorities and task list
- We're on branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Primary Task: Design Pattern Analysis

The user raised an important question about whether our portfolio example "agents" actually follow the Agent design pattern as defined in https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/agent.html

Please:
1. Review the PocketFlow Agent design pattern documentation
2. Analyze our portfolio example structure in `examples/portfolio_analysis/agents/`
3. Determine if our components are truly "agents" or if they follow a different pattern
4. Suggest more accurate terminology if needed

According to PocketFlow, an Agent should:
- Have autonomy and decision-making capability
- Maintain internal state
- Interact with external systems
- Follow specific patterns for initialization, execution, and communication

Our current structure has:
- QuantAnalyst, RiskAnalyst, PortfolioManager, ComplianceOfficer, DecisionNode
- Each has a node, signature, and models
- They're orchestrated through ClearFlow's flow system

## Questions to Answer:
1. Do our "agents" have true autonomy or are they just specialized processors?
2. Should we rename them to "specialists", "processors", "analyzers", or keep "agents"?
3. What design pattern from PocketFlow best describes what we've built?

## Secondary Tasks:
- Review other examples for consistency
- Prepare for final PR submission
- Ensure all documentation accurately describes our patterns

Start by examining the design patterns and making a recommendation about terminology.
