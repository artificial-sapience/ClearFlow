# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue our work on the ClearFlow message-driven architecture implementation.

## Context
Read `session-context.md` for the full context of our previous session where we successfully implemented and quality-checked the core message modules.

## Current Priority
Read `plan.md` for the detailed task list. The immediate priorities are:

### 1. Fix Examples Directory (45 min)
Complete the immutability fixes we started:
- We already began fixing `portfolio/models.py` and `quant/models.py`
- Still need to complete fixes for `risk/models.py` and `risk/node.py`
- Replace all `dict` with `Mapping` and `list` with `tuple`
- Ensure `./quality-check.sh` passes 100% without suppressions

### 2. Create Tests for Message Modules (2 hours)
After quality passes, create comprehensive tests in `tests/`:
- `test_message.py` - Test Message, Event, Command classes
- `test_message_node.py` - Test node processing
- `test_message_flow.py` - Test flow routing
- `test_observer.py` - Test observer pattern

### 3. Build Working Examples (3 hours)
Create examples demonstrating the new architecture's capabilities for AI orchestration.

## Key Constraints
- **NO SUPPRESSIONS**: Fix all issues at root cause
- Never use `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, or `# pyright: ignore`
- All code must pass `./quality-check.sh` 100%
- Maintain zero dependencies in ClearFlow core
- Use `Mapping` for immutable dict types, `tuple` for immutable sequences

## Success Criteria
The session is successful when:
1. Full `./quality-check.sh` passes (including examples)
2. Tests provide 100% coverage for message modules
3. Working examples demonstrate Commands vs Events and AI orchestration

Please start by running `./quality-check.sh` to see current status, then continue fixing the immutability violations in the examples directory.
