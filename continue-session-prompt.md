# Continue Session: Fix Message Flow Routing

Please continue working on the ClearFlow message-driven architecture implementation. 

## Context
See `session-context.md` for full background. We've successfully implemented the core message-driven architecture but have a critical bug in the flow builder routing logic.

## Immediate Task
Fix the `_MessageFlowBuilder.route()` method in `clearflow/message_flow.py` to correctly track which node produces each message type.

## The Bug
```python
# Current test failure:
test_message_flow.py::TestMessageFlow::test_flow_with_routing
Error: "No route defined for message type 'ValidateCommand' from node 'transform'"
```

The builder incorrectly assumes all messages come from the start node instead of tracking that each destination node becomes the producer of subsequent messages.

## Solution Approach
The most straightforward fix is to track that when we route a message to a destination node, that destination becomes the producer of the next routed message. Consider maintaining a "last routed node" or inferring producers from the routing sequence.

## After Fixing the Bug
1. Run all tests to ensure they pass
2. Check test coverage - aim for 100%
3. Run quality checks with `./quality-check.sh`

## Files to Focus On
- `clearflow/message_flow.py` - Fix the `_MessageFlowBuilder.route()` method
- `tests/test_message_flow.py` - Ensure all flow tests pass
- `tests/test_observer.py` - Run observer tests once flow tests pass
