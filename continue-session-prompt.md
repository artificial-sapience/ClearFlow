# Continue Session Prompt

## Mission Status: COMPLETE ✅

All quality improvement objectives have been successfully completed. The codebase is now in a production-ready state with:

- **0 pyright errors** (down from 2) 
- **88/88 tests passing** with 100% coverage
- **Grade A complexity** across all code
- **Zero unauthorized suppressions**
- **Public API principle enforced**: MessageFlow made public, all functions return only public types

## Current State

The codebase maintains mission-critical standards:
- All linting, formatting, architecture, and immutability compliance ✅
- Complete type safety with proper generic parameters ✅  
- Test suite compliance with proper complexity management ✅
- Security audits pass, no dead code ✅

## Key Architectural Improvements Completed

1. **Public API Design**: Made `MessageFlow` public (removed underscore prefix) and exported in `__all__`
2. **Type Safety**: Fixed all return type annotations and removed unauthorized suppressions
3. **Test Quality**: Extracted helper functions to achieve Grade A complexity in all test code
4. **Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with session learnings and architectural patterns

## Ready for Normal Development

All infrastructure and quality systems are fully operational. Continue with standard development workflow.
