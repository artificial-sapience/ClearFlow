# Continue Session Prompt

Please review @session-context.md and @plan.md to understand our current state.

We're working on the `support-state-type-transformations` branch. In the last session, we:
1. Removed mypy configuration in favor of pyright
2. Aligned CI workflows with quality-check.sh 
3. Modernized README with RAG pipeline quickstart

## Your First Actions

1. Check git status to see uncommitted changes
2. Run `./quality-check.sh` to verify all checks pass
3. Review the changes with `git diff` to ensure they're all intentional

## Primary Goal

Prepare and submit a PR for the `support-state-type-transformations` branch. The PR should highlight:
- Mypy removal (pyright is now sole type checker)
- CI workflow improvements (perfect alignment with quality-check.sh)
- README modernization (meaningful RAG example, correct API usage)

Please start by verifying the current state and running quality checks.
