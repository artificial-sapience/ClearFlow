# Continue Session: Fix Portfolio Example LLM Integration

## Critical Issue
**The message-driven portfolio example has LOST all LLM intelligence** - it's using hardcoded random logic instead of DSPy/OpenAI like the original.

## Context
- **Session context**: See session-context.md for what was accomplished
- **Tasks**: See plan.md for complete task list
- **Branch**: message-driven

## Your Immediate Priority

**Task 1**: Restore LLM intelligence to `examples/portfolio_analysis_message_driven/`

The original `examples/portfolio_analysis/` uses:
- DSPy with OpenAI GPT-5-nano
- Real LLM calls via `dspy.Predict()`
- Structured outputs with Pydantic

The message-driven version currently uses:
- `secrets.SystemRandom()` for fake randomness
- Hardcoded if/else logic
- No AI whatsoever

**Required Actions**:
1. Copy DSPy integration files from original example
2. Rewrite all nodes to use DSPy signatures
3. Ensure real LLM calls are made
4. Test with actual OpenAI API

## Next Session Prompt

**Claude, continue the ClearFlow migration to message-driven architecture.**

**CRITICAL**: The portfolio_analysis_message_driven example has lost all LLM intelligence. It's using hardcoded random logic instead of DSPy/OpenAI.

**Your task**: Fix the portfolio example by restoring full LLM integration from the original example while keeping the message-driven architecture.

**Context**: See session-context.md and plan.md in the working directory.

Please start by:
1. Comparing the original portfolio example's LLM usage with the current message-driven version
2. Planning the integration of DSPy into the message-driven nodes
3. Beginning the implementation
