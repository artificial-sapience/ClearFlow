# Continue Session Prompt

Please continue implementing the ClearFlow type transformation feature to achieve 100% quality check pass.

## Context Files to Review
1. **session-context.md** - What we accomplished and current blockers
2. **plan.md** - Remaining tasks with priority order

## Critical Issue to Resolve
The quality check is blocked by 46 architecture violations - all from tests using `dict[str, object]`.

## Your First Tasks
1. **Fix test type specificity** (Phase 1 in plan.md)
   - Replace all `dict[str, object]` with proper, educational types
   - Start with test_flow.py - create TicketState, WorkflowState, etc.
   - Each test should demonstrate real-world patterns

2. **Run quality-check.sh** after each file update
   - Goal: Reduce violations incrementally
   - Ensure tests remain passing with 100% coverage

## Why This Matters
Tests are **educational documentation**. When users see `dict[str, object]`, they learn the wrong pattern. When they see `TicketState` or `RAGQueryState`, they learn to model their domain properly.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ 0 architecture violations (currently 46)
- ✅ All tests using proper types (no `object`)
- ✅ 100% test coverage maintained
- ✅ Tests demonstrate real AI orchestration patterns

Start by reviewing the context files, then systematically fix each test file's types.
