# Continue Session: Complete Message API Finalization

Please continue working on the ClearFlow message-driven architecture implementation.

## Context

See `session-context.md` for full background. We successfully implemented the hybrid API and fixed the message flow routing bug, achieving 85/85 passing tests and 98.86% coverage. 

## Immediate Priority: Critical Decision Required

**Issue**: Message-based API is not exported in `clearflow.__init__.py` but tests import directly from submodules. This violates the "test only through public API" principle.

**Current State**:
- Tests import from: `clearflow.message_flow`, `clearflow.message_node`, `clearflow.observer` 
- But `clearflow.__init__.py` only exports: `["Node", "NodeResult", "flow"]` (original API)

**Decision Needed**: 
1. **Make message API public**: Add `message_flow`, `Message`, `Command`, `Event`, `ObservableFlow`, etc. to `__all__` in `clearflow/__init__.py`
2. **Keep message API internal**: Refactor tests to use only public API or document as implementation tests

Please make this architectural decision first, then proceed with remaining tasks.

## After Decision, Complete These Tasks

1. **Fix 71 Linting Issues** (HIGH priority)
   - Unused imports in test files  
   - Missing docstring returns
   - Method could be function warnings
   - Exception handling issues

2. **Achieve 100% Coverage** (HIGH priority)
   - Fix 2 uncovered lines in `message_node.py`
   - Currently at 98.86% (237 lines, 2 uncovered)

3. **Complete Quality Validation** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Ensure `./quality-check.sh` passes completely
   - Document any approved suppressions with justifications

## Current Status
- ✅ Hybrid API implemented and working
- ✅ All 85 tests passing
- ✅ Architecture/immutability/test compliance checks passing  
- ⚠️ 71 linting errors need fixing
- ⚠️ API publicity decision required

## Files to Focus On
- `clearflow/__init__.py` - Add message API exports if making public
- Test files - Fix linting issues (imports, docstrings)
- `clearflow/message_node.py` - Cover remaining 2 lines for 100%
