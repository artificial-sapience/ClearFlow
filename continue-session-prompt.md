# Continue Session: PLR6301 Test Method Conversion

Please continue working on the ClearFlow message-driven architecture implementation.

## Context

See `session-context.md` for complete background. We successfully completed the critical message API finalization, achieving 100% test coverage, resolving all architecture violations, and making the message API public with proper enforcement.

## Current Status: ðŸŽ‰ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED (Almost!)

The message-driven architecture is **functionally complete** with:
- âœ… **85/85 tests passing**
- âœ… **100% test coverage** 
- âœ… **All critical linting resolved**
- âœ… **Message API properly exported**
- âœ… **Architecture compliance enforced**

## Single Remaining Task: PLR6301 Style Improvement

**Objective**: Convert 48 test methods that don't use `self` to standalone functions

**Priority**: LOW (style improvement only - no functional impact)

**Status**: User approved conversion plan in previous session

## Implementation Details

**Pattern**: Convert class methods to standalone functions
```python
# Instead of:
class TestMessage:
    async def test_message_type_property(self) -> None:
        """Test that message_type returns the concrete class type."""
        ...

# Convert to:
async def test_message_type_property() -> None:
    """Test that message_type returns the concrete class type."""
    ...
```

**Files to Convert** (48 total methods):
- `tests/test_message.py` - 16 methods
- `tests/test_message_flow.py` - 11 methods  
- `tests/test_message_node.py` - 10 methods
- `tests/test_observer.py` - 11 methods

## Instructions

1. **Start systematic conversion** of test methods to functions
2. **Remove empty test classes** after converting all their methods
3. **Verify all tests still pass** after each file conversion
4. **Maintain test organization** through clear function naming
5. **Complete quality validation** with final `./quality-check.sh`

## Expected Outcome

After conversion:
- All PLR6301 warnings resolved
- Tests remain functionally identical (85/85 passing)
- Code clarity improved (functions are honest about not using instance state)
- Aligns with ClearFlow "fix root cause" philosophy
