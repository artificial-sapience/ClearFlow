# Session Context: ClearFlow Type Transformation Implementation

## Current State Summary
The type transformation feature `Node[TIn, TOut=TIn]` is functionally complete but blocked by quality checks. The architecture linter shows 46 violations, all in test files using `dict[str, object]`.

## Session Accomplishments

### 1. Test Suite Reorganization ✅
- Split 1081-line `test_clearflow.py` into 6 focused modules
- Created `conftest.py` with shared immutable types
- Maintained 100% test coverage
- All 20 tests passing

### 2. Tool Configuration Cleanup ✅
- Removed aspirational configs from pyproject.toml:
  - `[tool.vulture]` - doesn't auto-read pyproject.toml
  - `[tool.xenon]` - command-line only
  - `[tool.radon]` - command-line only
- Kept configs for tools that DO auto-read pyproject.toml

### 3. Quality Check Script Optimization ✅
- Updated quality-check.sh to leverage pyproject.toml
- Tools that auto-read configs now run without redundant args
- Maintained CLI flexibility for specific file/directory targeting
- Reduced duplication between script and config

### 4. Architecture Linter Enhancement ✅
- Fixed suppression detection for `ast.Name` nodes
- Linter now recognizes `# clearflow: ignore[ARCH009]` comments
- Added suppressions to clearflow/__init__.py with justifications
- Reduced violations from 88 to 46

### 5. Example Code Improvements ✅
- Replaced `Any` type with proper `TypedDict` in chat example
- Created well-typed `ChatMessage` and `ChatState` structures
- Examples now demonstrate best practices with zero `Any` usage

## Critical Blocker
**46 architecture violations remain** - all in test files using `dict[str, object]`

### Why This Matters
- Tests are **educational** - they show users how to use ClearFlow
- `dict[str, object]` teaches bad patterns
- Real users have specific types, not generic objects
- Type transformations lose their value if everything is `object`

### Examples of What Tests Should Use
Instead of `dict[str, object]`:
- `TicketState` with fields like priority, status, assignee
- `RAGQueryState` with query, max_results, filters
- `ToolExecutionState` with tool_name, parameters, result

## Key Technical Insights

### Tools and pyproject.toml
- **Auto-readers**: ruff, mypy, pyright, pytest, coverage, bandit, interrogate
- **Manual config needed**: vulture, xenon, radon
- **Lesson**: Don't add configs that tools won't use

### Architecture Compliance
- `object` type is necessary for runtime routing in Flow internals
- Suppressions with justifications serve as documentation
- Tests should NOT use `object` - they should be type-exemplars

## Files Modified This Session
- `pyproject.toml` - removed unused tool configs
- `quality-check.sh` - leverages pyproject.toml better
- `linters/check-architecture-compliance.py` - fixed suppression detection
- `clearflow/__init__.py` - added justified suppressions
- `examples/chat/` - proper TypedDict instead of Any
- `tests/` - split into 6 focused modules + conftest.py

## Next Session Focus
See `plan.md` for detailed tasks. Priority order:
1. Replace `dict[str, object]` in all test files with proper types
2. Add remaining suppression for parameter violation
3. Create type transformation examples

The goal: **0 architecture violations** with educational, type-safe tests that demonstrate real-world patterns.
