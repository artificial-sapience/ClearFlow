# ClearFlow Session Context

## Current Branch
`support-state-type-transformations`

## Session Overview
This session focused on achieving 100% quality compliance for the linters/ directory, treating linters as critical infrastructure that must meet the same quality standards as production code.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Complexity Reduction ✅
**Initial State**: 
- `check_file_imports` had complexity 27 (max allowed 7)
- Multiple functions with complexity 8-16

**Refactoring Approach**:
- Extract helper functions for single responsibilities
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Combine conditions to reduce branches
- Create dispatch functions for node type handling

**Result**: 
- Maximum complexity reduced from 27 to 9
- Most functions now below complexity threshold
- Code is more maintainable and testable

### 2. Code Quality Improvements ✅
**Fixed Issues**:
- PERF401: Replaced loops with list comprehensions/extend
- SIM102: Combined nested if statements
- BLE001: Fixed broad exception handling
- FBT001: Made boolean parameters keyword-only
- E501: Fixed line length issues
- C408: Replaced `tuple()` with `()`

**Type Safety**:
- Added type annotations to all variables requiring them
- Fixed mypy strict mode violations
- Ensured all functions have proper return type hints

### 3. Systematic Refactoring Examples

#### Helper Function Extraction
```python
# Before: One complex function with 27 complexity
def check_file_imports(...):
    # 150+ lines checking multiple violation types

# After: Multiple focused helpers
def _check_private_imports(...) -> Violation | None
def _check_mock_imports(...) -> tuple[Violation, ...]
def _check_typing_imports(...) -> tuple[Violation, ...]
def _check_import_from_node(...) -> tuple[Violation, ...]
def _process_node(...) -> tuple[Violation, ...]
def check_file_imports(...):  # Now just orchestration
```

#### Pattern Simplification
```python
# Before: Complex nested conditions
if isinstance(node, ast.Call):
    if isinstance(node.func, ast.Attribute):
        if node.func.value.id == "asyncio":
            violations.append(...)

# After: Combined conditions
if (isinstance(node, ast.Call) 
    and isinstance(node.func, ast.Attribute)
    and node.func.value.id == "asyncio"):
    violations.append(...)
```

#### List Comprehensions
```python
# Before: Loop with append
for node in classes_to_check:
    if not _has_frozen_config(node):
        violations.append(Violation(...))

# After: List comprehension with extend
violations.extend(
    Violation(...) 
    for node in classes_to_check 
    if not _has_frozen_config(node)
)
```

## Key Technical Insights

### Complexity Management
- Functions with many elif branches benefit from dispatch patterns
- Early returns dramatically reduce nesting and complexity
- Helper functions should have single, clear responsibilities
- Combining related conditions reduces cyclomatic complexity

### Type Safety in Linters
- All collections need explicit type hints: `list[Violation]`
- Dictionary types need full specification: `dict[str, list[Violation]]`
- AST nodes have specific types that should be preserved
- Keyword-only parameters prevent positional boolean confusion

### Quality Standards
- Linters are critical infrastructure requiring same standards as production code
- Zero suppressions principle applies to linters too
- Complexity limits ensure maintainability
- Type safety prevents subtle bugs in checking logic

## Current State

### What Works ✅
- All custom compliance checks pass (architecture, immutability, test-suite)
- Complexity dramatically reduced (27 → 9)
- Type annotations complete
- Most linting issues resolved
- Code is more maintainable and testable

### What Needs Completion
- Final quality check verification
- Possibly a few minor formatting issues
- Confirm 100% compliance achieved

## Files Modified
- `linters/check-architecture-compliance.py` - Major refactoring, reduced from complexity 27 to ~10
- `linters/check-immutability.py` - Refactored complex functions, added helper methods
- `linters/check-test-suite-compliance.py` - Simplified event loop checking, fixed type annotations
- `quality-check.sh` - (read for reference)

## Next Steps
See plan.md for remaining tasks. Primary focus: verify 100% quality compliance for linters/.
