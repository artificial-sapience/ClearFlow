# Session Context

## Branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Major Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Portfolio Example Refactoring ✅
**Critical Insight**: Our portfolio example components were incorrectly named "agents" but actually follow the **Workflow pattern**, not the Agent pattern.

**Actions Taken**:
- Renamed `examples/portfolio_analysis/agents/` → `examples/portfolio_analysis/specialists/`
- Updated all imports and references throughout codebase
- Updated documentation to accurately describe the pattern

**Why This Matters**: 
- Agents have autonomy and dynamic decision-making
- Our components are specialized processors with fixed routing
- Accurate terminology prevents confusion about design patterns

### 2. Documentation Cleanup ✅
**Problem**: Excessive disclaimers and inaccurate claims about minimalism

**Changes Made**:
- Removed 13+ redundant disclaimers about "educational" and "simulated data"
- Kept one simple disclaimer at top of README
- Removed "~250 lines" claim (already 296+ lines and growing)
- Removed line count comparison with PocketFlow
- Fixed redundant "state transformations" wording

**Philosophy Shift**: ClearFlow's value isn't minimalism, it's **correctness and safety** for mission-critical AI orchestration.

### 3. README Restructuring ✅
**Decision**: Removed the 65-line "Quickstart" section entirely

**Rationale**:
- Not actually "Hello World" simple
- PocketFlow proved you don't need quickstart
- Examples section is sufficient
- More respectful of users' time

**New Structure**:
1. Why ClearFlow? → Installation → Examples → Core Concepts → Development

### 4. Examples Organization ✅
**Strategy**: Domain-based naming with pattern documentation

**Current Examples**:
- `chat/` - Simple conversational flow
- `portfolio_analysis/` - Multi-specialist workflow pattern

**Future Examples** (planned):
- RAG - Full retrieval-augmented generation
- Agent - True autonomous decision-making
- Map-Reduce - Distributed processing pattern

### 5. Badge Additions ✅
Added credibility badges:
- Downloads (pepy.tech) - Shows adoption
- Type: Pyright - Emphasizes type safety
- Ruff - Shows code quality commitment

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Keep specialist class names** (QuantAnalyst, RiskAnalyst, etc.) - they accurately describe roles
2. **Use domain-based example naming** - Users think in problems, not patterns
3. **No quickstart needed** - Examples are sufficient
4. **Quality over minimalism** - Adding validation and guardrails is worth extra lines

## Current State

- ✅ All quality checks passing (100% coverage, type safety, no linting issues)
- ✅ Portfolio example correctly describes its pattern (Workflow, not Agent)
- ✅ README is cleaner and more honest about ClearFlow's value proposition
- ✅ Examples section provides clear entry points for users

## What's Next

See `plan.md` for remaining tasks:
- Consider creating simple examples
- Prepare and submit PR
- Future: timeout/max iterations support
