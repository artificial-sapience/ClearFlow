# Session Context: Message-Driven Architecture Implementation

## Session Overview
This session focused on designing and implementing a message-driven architecture for ClearFlow to enable type-safe AI orchestration. We evolved from string-based outcomes to strongly typed messages with causality tracking.

## Key Breakthroughs

### Architecture Evolution
- **From**: String outcomes `NodeResult(state, outcome="success")`  
- **To**: Typed messages `return SuccessEvent(data=result, triggered_by_id=input.id)`
- **Benefit**: Compile-time type safety, AI agent orchestration capabilities

### AI Orchestration Insight
The crucial realization: AI agents need **agency** - they should be able to issue Commands (intent/delegation) in addition to Events (facts). This enables:
- Dynamic decision-making based on analysis
- Delegation to specialized agents/tools  
- Multi-step orchestration with explicit control flow
- Commands can start new sub-flows or invoke external services

### Layered Architecture Design
We designed a **two-layer approach**:

1. **Core Layer**: Pure business logic with explicit message routing
   ```python
   flow = message_flow("Pipeline", ValidateNode())
       .route(ValidatedEvent, ProcessNode())
       .end(CompletedEvent)
   ```

2. **Observable Layer**: Non-invasive cross-cutting concerns
   ```python
   observable = ObservableFlow(core_flow)
       .observe(Event, EventLogger())
       .observe(PaymentEvent, FraudDetector())
   ```

## Implementation Status

### Completed Modules
All four core modules implemented in `/Users/richard/Developer/github/artificial-sapience/clearflow/`:

1. **`message.py`** - Foundation classes:
   - `Message` (ABC with causality metadata) 
   - `Event` (facts, requires `triggered_by_id`)
   - `Command` (intent, optional `triggered_by_id`)

2. **`message_node.py`** - Processing units:
   - `Node[TMessageIn, TMessageOut]` with abstract `process()` method
   - Supports AI intelligence in message transformation decisions

3. **`message_flow.py`** - Type-safe orchestration:
   - `MessageFlow` executes routing based on message types
   - `MessageFlowBuilder` with fluent API for route definition  
   - Routes: `(message_type, node_name) -> next_node`

4. **`observer.py`** - Cross-cutting concerns:
   - `Observer[TMessage]` for side-effect processing
   - `ObservableFlow` wraps core flows with observation
   - Async observer execution with error isolation

### Quality Status
-  Architecture compliance (no violations)
-  Immutability compliance (all frozen dataclasses)  
-  Test suite compliance (proper async patterns)
- = Linting: 29 whitespace/documentation issues remaining (auto-fixable)
- = Type checking: Not yet run on final code

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Message Causality Tracking
Every message carries metadata:
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class Message(ABC):
    id: uuid.UUID = field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4)
    triggered_by_id: uuid.UUID | None  # None for Commands, UUID for Events
    timestamp: datetime = field(default_factory=_utc_now)  
    flow_id: uuid.UUID  # Required - identifies session
```

#### Observer Error Isolation
Observers can't break main flows:
- Run in background via `asyncio.create_task()`
- Exceptions caught and logged, don't propagate
- Static methods for better performance
- Type-safe observer registration by message type

#### Message Routing Strategy
- Route key: `(type(message), node.name)`
- Type-safe at compile time through generics
- Explicit termination via `route_key -> None`
- Runtime validation for missing routes

## Design Document Location
Complete architecture specification: `/Users/richard/Developer/github/artificial-sapience/clearflow/docs/message-driven-architecture-proposal.md`

Includes:
- Detailed design rationale
- Complete implementation examples (RAG pipeline)
- Migration strategy from string-based flows
- Observer pattern examples (logging, metrics, fraud detection)
- Performance considerations and tradeoffs

## Current Blockers
1. **Linting Issues**: 29 auto-fixable formatting violations
2. **Observer Task Reference**: RUF006 warning about unused `asyncio.create_task` return value
3. **No Tests Yet**: Need basic test coverage before further development

## Next Session Priority
See `plan.md` for detailed task breakdown. Immediate focus:
1. Fix remaining linting issues (`ruff format` + observer task handling)
2. Create basic tests for message system
3. Build working examples demonstrating AI orchestration

## Context for AI Assistant
- This is a **refactoring** of existing ClearFlow, not greenfield development
- Must maintain **zero dependencies** and **100% test coverage**
- Focus on **AI orchestration** capabilities, not general message processing
- **Backwards compatibility** required during transition
- User prefers **explicit over implicit** behavior (ClearFlow philosophy)
