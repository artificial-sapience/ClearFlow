# ClearFlow Session Context

## Session Focus
This session tackled two major quality improvements: resolving PLR6301 style warnings and fixing type safety issues with Command/Event classes. Both tasks were successfully completed, though new architecture violations were introduced that need addressing.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ‚úÖ PLR6301 Test Method Conversion (COMPLETED)
Successfully converted 48 test methods that didn't use `self` to standalone functions.

**Philosophy**: Fix root cause rather than suppress warnings - methods that don't use instance state shouldn't be methods.

**Implementation**:
- Converted methods to functions in 4 test files
- Removed unnecessary `async` from functions that don't await
- All 86 tests still passing

**Files Updated**:
- `tests/test_message.py`: 16 methods ‚Üí functions
- `tests/test_message_flow.py`: 11 methods ‚Üí functions  
- `tests/test_message_node.py`: 10 methods ‚Üí functions
- `tests/test_observer.py`: 11 methods ‚Üí functions

### 2. ‚úÖ Command/Event Abstract Base Classes (COMPLETED)
Fixed pyright errors about `@final` classes being subclassed by implementing proper abstract base classes.

**Problem Evolution**:
1. Initial state: `Command` and `Event` marked `@final` ‚Üí 9 pyright errors
2. Attempt 1: Remove `@final` ‚Üí allows unwanted direct instantiation
3. Attempt 2: Add dummy abstract method ‚Üí poor developer UX
4. **Final solution**: Custom metaclass with clean UX ‚úÖ

**Implementation - Custom Metaclass**:
```python
class AbstractMessageMeta(ABCMeta):
    """Metaclass that prevents direct instantiation of Event and Command."""
    
    def __call__(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
        if cls.__name__ == "Event" and cls.__module__ == "clearflow.message":
            raise TypeError(
                "Cannot instantiate abstract Event directly. "
                "Create a concrete event class (e.g., ProcessedEvent)."
            )
        # Similar check for Command
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean UX - no boilerplate in subclasses
- Strict enforcement - `Event()` and `Command()` fail with clear errors
- Zero breaking changes - all tests continue working

## Current Issues

### üî• Architecture Violations (NEW)
The custom metaclass introduced 4 ARCH010 violations for using `Any` type:
```python
def __call__(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:  # 4 violations
```

**Next step**: Replace with specific types or justify exception for metaclass patterns.

### Remaining Type Errors
~76 pyright errors remain in test files, primarily related to:
- Flow routing type variance issues
- Node generic constraints in message_flow
- Observable flow type inference

See `plan.md` for detailed breakdown.

## Quality Metrics

### Current State
- **Tests**: 86/86 passing ‚úÖ
- **Coverage**: 98.57% (was 100%, metaclass code not directly tested)
- **Architecture**: 4 violations (Any type usage)
- **Type checking**: 9 errors fixed, ~76 remain
- **Linting**: All PLR6301 warnings resolved ‚úÖ

### What Changed This Session
- ‚úÖ Resolved 48 PLR6301 warnings
- ‚úÖ Fixed 9 pyright errors in conftest_message.py
- ‚ùå Added 4 architecture violations (Any type)
- ‚ùå Coverage dropped 1.43% (metaclass not directly tested)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Custom Metaclass?
After evaluating multiple approaches, chose metaclass for:
- **Best UX**: No boilerplate required in user code
- **Strict enforcement**: Actually prevents instantiation
- **Clear errors**: Helpful messages guide developers
- **Hidden complexity**: Implementation details invisible to users

### Test Organization Philosophy
Converted methods to functions because:
- Honest about requirements (no fake `self` parameter)
- Aligns with "fix root cause" principle
- Industry best practice for test organization
- Clearer intent and simpler code

## Files Modified

### Core Library
- `clearflow/message.py`: Added `AbstractMessageMeta`, made Command/Event abstract

### Test Files (PLR6301 conversion)
- `tests/test_message.py`: 16 conversions
- `tests/test_message_flow.py`: 11 conversions
- `tests/test_message_node.py`: 10 conversions
- `tests/test_observer.py`: 11 conversions

## Next Session Priority

1. **Fix Architecture Violations** (BLOCKING)
   - Replace `Any` types in metaclass
   - See `plan.md` for options

2. **Resolve Remaining Type Errors**
   - Focus on flow routing issues
   - May require generic constraint adjustments
