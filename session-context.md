# ClearFlow Session Context

## Session Focus
This session completed major type safety improvements and fixed design issues in the message-driven architecture.

## Key Design Insights

### Type Erasure Philosophy
**Principle**: "Be most correct. Only type erase when and where we must."
- Accept full types at API boundaries (e.g., `Node[TNodeIn, TNodeOut]`)
- Only erase internally where necessary (e.g., storage as `Node[Message, Message]`)
- This parallels the pattern in `clearflow/__init__.py`

### Metaclass Pattern for Abstract Classes
Successfully implemented `AbstractMessageMeta` to prevent direct instantiation of `Command` and `Event` while maintaining clean UX:
- Uses standard Python metaclass signature: `def __call__(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any`
- Matches typeshed's `type.__call__` exactly
- Required extending architecture linter to support ARCH010 suppressions

## Major Technical Changes

### 1. Fixed `from_node()` Signatures
**Before**: `def from_node[TNodeOut: Message](self, node: Node[Message, TNodeOut])`
**After**: `def from_node[TNodeIn: Message, TNodeOut: Message](self, node: Node[TNodeIn, TNodeOut])`

This accepts nodes as they actually exist without forcing type erasure.

### 2. Fixed `route()` Method for Union Types
**Before**: `def route[TNextMessage](self, message_type: type[TCurrentMessage], to_node: Node[TCurrentMessage, TNextMessage])`
**After**: `def route[TRouteMessage: Message, TNextMessage: Message](self, message_type: type[TRouteMessage], to_node: Node[TRouteMessage, TNextMessage])`

This allows routing specific types from union outputs (e.g., routing just `ProcessedEvent` from `ProcessedEvent | ErrorEvent`).

### 3. Fixed Return Types
Changed `end()` and `add_termination()` to return `_MessageFlow` instead of `Node`, matching actual return types.

## Files Modified

### Core Library
- `clearflow/message.py`: Metaclass with standard signature
- `clearflow/message_flow.py`: Fixed `from_node()`, `route()`, and return types
- `linters/check-architecture-compliance.py`: Added ARCH010 suppression support

### Test Files
- `tests/test_message.py`: Added metaclass tests, removed unnecessary type ignores
- `tests/test_message_flow.py`: Fixed test logic revealed by improved type checking

## Type Error Progression
- Started: 78 pyright errors (mostly contravariance issues)
- After `from_node()` fix: 50 errors
- After `route()` fix: 3 errors
- Final: 2 errors (intentional test cases)

## Current State
- All 88 tests passing with 100% coverage
- Architecture compliance achieved (with justified suppressions)
- 2 remaining pyright errors in test files where we intentionally create invalid flows for testing

## Next Steps
See `plan.md` for remaining tasks (fixing 2 test type annotations).
