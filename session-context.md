# Session Context

## Branch: `support-state-type-transformations`

## Session Accomplishments ✅

### 1. Portfolio Example Bug Fixes
**Fixed Market Sentiment Bug:**
- Changed `market_data.py:142` from `random.choice()` to fixed `"neutral"` for normal scenario
- Ensures consistent behavior for "normal" market conditions

**Fixed LLM Hallucination Issues:**
- Updated all DSPy signatures to explicitly constrain outputs to provided symbols
- Added "You MUST ONLY use symbols from the provided market_data" to each signature
- Fixed hardcoded real tickers in validators (changed to fictional TECH-01, FIN-01, etc.)

### 2. Portfolio Example Reorganization 🏗️
**Agent-Centric Module Structure:**
```
portfolio_analysis/
├── agents/
│   ├── quant/       # QuantAnalyst: node, signature, models
│   ├── risk/        # RiskAnalyst: node, signature, models  
│   ├── portfolio/   # PortfolioManager: node, signature, models
│   ├── compliance/  # ComplianceOfficer: node, signature, models, validators
│   └── decision/    # DecisionNode, ErrorHandler: nodes, signature, models
├── shared/          # MarketData, AssetData, AnalysisError, config
├── market_data.py   # Input data generation
├── portfolio_flow.py # Flow orchestration
└── main.py          # Entry point
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Each agent's components are cohesively organized
- Clear ownership and boundaries
- Easy to locate and modify agent-specific logic
- Clean import structure
- All quality checks pass

### 3. UI Improvements
- Made "Normal market conditions" the default (option 1)
- Removed "Run all scenarios" option
- Updated prompt to show "Enter choice (1-3, default=1):"

## Technical Decisions Made

### Import Organization
- Agents import from their own modules
- Shared types in `shared/` module
- Flow imports from agents and shared
- Main imports from agents for specific types needed

### File Cleanup
Successfully removed all migrated files:
- `config.py` → `shared/config.py`
- `models.py` → split across agent modules
- `nodes.py` → split across agent modules
- `signatures.py` → split across agent modules
- `validators.py` → `agents/compliance/validators.py`

## Code Quality Status
- ✅ All custom linters pass
- ✅ Ruff linting/formatting clean
- ✅ Pyright strict mode passes
- ✅ 100% test coverage maintained
- ✅ Security audits pass
- ✅ Complexity Grade A (avg: 2.11)

## Important Question Raised

**Design Pattern Consideration:**
User pointed to https://the-pocket.github.io/PocketFlow/design_pattern/agent.html and asked whether our "agents" actually follow the Agent design pattern or if we should use a more appropriate term.

This needs investigation in the next session to ensure we're using accurate terminology.

## Next Session Focus

See `plan.md` for detailed next steps, but primary focus should be:
1. Analyze if our "agents" follow the Agent design pattern
2. Consider terminology updates if needed
3. Review other examples for consistency
4. Prepare for PR submission
