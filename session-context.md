# Session Context: ClearFlow API Simplification & Quality Improvements

## Major Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Simplified API Design ✅
- **Replaced Flow class with flow() function**: Eliminated unnecessary abstraction
- **Signature**: `def flow[TIn, TOut](name: str, start: Node[TIn, TOut]) -> _FlowBuilder[TIn, TOut]`
- **Type inference**: TOut correctly infers from the node (no need for default in flow function)
- **Cleaner usage**: `flow("Pipeline", my_node).route(...).build()` instead of `Flow[T]("name").start_with(node)`

### 2. Improved Type System ✅
- **Better generic tracking**: `_FlowBuilder[TIn, TCurrent]` tracks current type during building
- **Node defaults**: `Node[TIn, TOut = TIn]` - TOut defaults to TIn for non-transforming nodes
- **Reduced object usage**: Eliminated many `object` types during build phase (from 12 to 8 violations)

### 3. Fixed Architecture Linter ✅
- **Multi-line suppression support**: Linter now checks next 2 lines for suppressions
- **Handles complex annotations**: Works with multi-line type annotations like `Node[TIn, object]`
- **Better suppression detection**: Fixed both parameter and general `object` type suppressions

### 4. Fixed quality-check.sh Script ✅
- **All tools respect arguments**: Fixed pip-audit, Bandit, Xenon, Vulture, Interrogate, Radon
- **Scope-aware CVE scanning**: Skips pip-audit for clearflow/ (zero dependencies)
- **Dynamic target handling**: All tools now use `$QUALITY_TARGETS` instead of hardcoded paths
- **Proper aggregation**: Radon correctly aggregates complexity across multiple targets

## Current State

### Core Library Status
- **Architecture compliance**: ✅ PASSING (0 violations with suppressions)
- **Immutability compliance**: ✅ PASSING  
- **Test suite compliance**: ✅ PASSING
- **Linting (Ruff)**: ✅ PASSING
- **Type checking (mypy)**: ✅ PASSING
- **Type checking (pyright)**: ✅ PASSING (with necessary ignores)
- **Complexity (Xenon)**: ❌ FAILING (_Flow.exec has rank B, needs A)
- **Other tools**: ✅ PASSING (Bandit, Vulture, Interrogate, Radon)

### Remaining Issues
1. **_Flow.exec() complexity**: Rank B, needs refactoring to achieve rank A
2. **Tests need updating**: Still using old `Flow` class API
3. **Test types need fixing**: 45 violations for using `dict[str, object]` instead of proper types

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why flow() function over Flow class?
- Less ceremony, cleaner API
- Type inference works better (both TIn and TOut from node)
- One less abstraction to understand
- Follows "make simple things simple" principle

### Why keep OOP for _FlowBuilder?
- Method chaining is idiomatic in Python: `.route().route().build()`
- Encapsulation keeps related operations together
- Already functional in nature (immutable, returns new instances)
- Reduction in lines with functional approach would be minimal

### Why TOut doesn't default in flow()?
- Node already has the default: `Node[TIn, TOut = TIn]`
- flow() infers types from the node passed to it
- Avoids redundant defaults that could get out of sync
- Cleaner, simpler signature

## Files Modified This Session

### Core Library
- `clearflow/__init__.py`: Replaced Flow class with flow() function, improved type tracking
- `linters/check-architecture-compliance.py`: Added multi-line suppression support

### Infrastructure
- `quality-check.sh`: Fixed all tools to respect argument scope
- `pyproject.toml`: No changes (already optimized)

### Documentation
- `plan.md`: Updated with clear next steps
- `session-context.md`: This file (complete session summary)
- `continue-session-prompt.md`: To be created with continuation prompt

## Next Session Focus

See `plan.md` for detailed tasks. Priority order:
1. **Simplify _FlowBuilder**: Keep OOP but reduce complexity
2. **Fix _Flow.exec() complexity**: Refactor to achieve rank A
3. **Update all tests**: Convert to new flow() API
4. **Fix test types**: Replace `dict[str, object]` with educational types

The goal is a simpler, cleaner ClearFlow that maintains its type safety guarantees while being easier to understand and use.
