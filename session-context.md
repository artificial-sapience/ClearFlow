# Session Context: ClearFlow Message-Driven Architecture

## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing and refining the message-driven architecture for ClearFlow, transitioning from string-based outcomes to strongly-typed messages for improved type safety and AI orchestration capabilities.

## Completed Work

### 1. Core Implementation
Successfully implemented the message-driven architecture across four main modules:

- **clearflow/message.py**: Base classes for Message, Command, and Event with automatic UUID generation, timestamp tracking, and causality chains
- **clearflow/message_node.py**: Node abstraction for processing messages (replaces state-based nodes)
- **clearflow/message_flow.py**: Flow routing with `_MessageFlow` and `_MessageFlowBuilder` for type-safe message routing
- **clearflow/observer.py**: Observer pattern for cross-cutting concerns

### 2. Key Design Evolution

#### LSP Violation Discovery and Resolution
- **Problem**: Initial ObservableFlow tried to wrap any Node and detect _MessageFlow at runtime
- **Solution**: ObservableFlow explicitly decorates only `_MessageFlow` types
- **Principle**: "We observe workflows (flows), not individual operations (nodes)"

#### Fail-Fast Observer Pattern
- **Change**: Removed error isolation (`return_exceptions=True` in asyncio.gather)
- **Benefit**: SecurityObserver can immediately halt suspicious operations
- **Implementation**: Exceptions propagate naturally, stopping the entire flow

#### Composability Through Node Interface
- **Design**: `_MessageFlow` extends `Node[TStartMessage, TEndMessage]`
- **Benefit**: Flows can be nested within other flows
- **Pattern**: Decorator pattern for ObservableFlow maintains composability

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Added comprehensive section to `docs/message-driven-architecture-proposal.md`
- Documented LSP violation discovery and resolution
- Explained decorator pattern implementation
- Clarified design principle: observe flows, not nodes

### 4. Test Suite Creation
Created comprehensive test suite covering all message components:
- `tests/conftest_message.py`: Shared test utilities and message types
- `tests/test_message.py`: Tests for Message, Command, Event (16 tests passing)
- `tests/test_message_node.py`: Tests for message Node abstraction (9 tests passing)
- `tests/test_message_flow.py`: Tests for flow routing (1 failing - routing issue)
- `tests/test_observer.py`: Tests for observer pattern (not fully run yet)

## Current Issue: Flow Builder Routing Logic

### The Problem
The `_MessageFlowBuilder` cannot correctly determine which node produces a message type when building routes.

### Code Location
File: `clearflow/message_flow.py`, lines 133-143 in `_MessageFlowBuilder.route()`

### Current Incorrect Logic
```python
# Tries to find producer by searching existing routes
for msg_type, node_name in self._routes:
    if msg_type == message_type:
        producing_node_name = node_name
        break
```

### Why It Fails
- Routes are keyed by `(message_type, producer_node)`
- The code searches for a route with the message type, then uses its node_name
- This is circular - we're trying to create the route but looking for it in existing routes
- Falls back to assuming start node produces everything (line 143)

### Test Case That Fails
```python
flow = (
    message_flow("pipeline", start)
    .route(ProcessedEvent, transform)  # Creates: (ProcessedEvent, "start") -> transform
    .route(ValidateCommand, validate)  # Should create: (ValidateCommand, "transform") -> validate
                                       # But creates: (ValidateCommand, "start") -> validate
)
```

### Runtime Error
When transform outputs ValidateCommand, the flow looks for route `(ValidateCommand, "transform")` but only has `(ValidateCommand, "start")`, causing: "No route defined for message type 'ValidateCommand' from node 'transform'"

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation Files
- `clearflow/message.py` - Message hierarchy implementation
- `clearflow/message_node.py` - Node abstraction for messages
- `clearflow/message_flow.py` - Flow routing (has bug to fix)
- `clearflow/observer.py` - Observer pattern with fail-fast

### Test Files Created
- `tests/conftest_message.py`
- `tests/test_message.py`
- `tests/test_message_node.py`
- `tests/test_message_flow.py`
- `tests/test_observer.py`

### Documentation
- `docs/message-driven-architecture-proposal.md` - Added "Design Evolution" section

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Naming Convention**: `_MessageFlow` with underscore means package-internal, not truly private
2. **Error Handling**: Fail-fast for observers - no error isolation
3. **Type Safety**: Explicit typing with no runtime type checking needed
4. **Composability**: Flows are Nodes, allowing nesting
5. **Observation Scope**: Only flows are observable, not individual nodes

## Next Steps
See `plan.md` for detailed task list. Primary focus: Fix the flow builder routing logic.
