## Major Session Accomplishments

### 1. Flow Builder Validation System âœ…
Implemented comprehensive build-time validation to prevent invalid flow construction:

**Reachability Validation:**
- Nodes can only be routed from if reachable from start
- Termination nodes must be reachable  
- Prevents disconnected subgraphs
- Clear error messages: "Cannot route from 'orphan' - not reachable from start"

**Duplicate Route Detection:**
- Each (node, outcome) pair must be unique
- Prevents silent route overwrites
- Error: "Route already defined for outcome 'done' from node 'start'"

**Implementation:**
- Added `_reachable: frozenset[str]` to `_FlowBuilder`
- Created `_validate_and_create_route()` helper (DRY principle)
- Context-aware errors using `is_termination` parameter
- New test file: `test_flow_builder_validation.py`
- 100% coverage maintained

### 2. Documentation & Branding Updates âœ…
- **New tagline**: "Type-safe orchestration for unpredictable AI"
- Fixed confusing quickstart example (was using ClearFlow API changes as example)
- Changed to T-800 robot specs example (clearly fictional)

### 3. Code Refactoring âœ…
- Eliminated validation logic duplication
- Handled DOC502 linter issue (doesn't understand exception propagation)
- Added justified suppression in `pyproject.toml`

### 4. Critical Issues Discovered in Portfolio Example ðŸš¨

**Market Sentiment Bug:**
- `market_data.py:147` uses `random.choice()` for "normal" scenario
- Should be consistent "neutral", not random
- Causes confusion when "normal" shows as "bullish"

**LLM Hallucination Issue:**
- Portfolio Manager outputs real ETF tickers (QQQ, VOO, VXUS, XLE, XLU)
- Input uses fictional tickers (TECH-01, FIN-01, etc.)
- No validation constraining outputs to input symbols
- DSPy signature doesn't prevent hallucination

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The DSPy signatures don't explicitly tell agents "you MUST use ONLY the symbols from the provided data". The agents need explicit constraints like:
- "You must ONLY recommend allocation changes for the symbols present in the input market data"
- "Do NOT introduce any new ticker symbols not found in the provided assets"
- "Your recommendations must reference ONLY: [list of input symbols]"

## Code Quality Status
- âœ… All custom linters pass
- âœ… Ruff linting/formatting clean
- âœ… Pyright strict mode passes
- âœ… 100% test coverage
- âœ… Security audits pass
- âœ… Complexity Grade A

## Files Modified This Session
1. `clearflow/__init__.py` - Validation logic
2. `tests/test_flow_builder_validation.py` - New tests
3. `README.md` - Tagline and examples
4. `pyproject.toml` - DOC502 suppression
5. `plan.md` - Updated priorities

## Critical Learnings

### Build-Time vs Runtime Validation
Build-time validation (failing at flow construction) is far superior to runtime errors. Users get immediate feedback about invalid flows.

### LLM Constraints Are Critical
Unconstrained LLMs will use training knowledge rather than limiting to provided data. The portfolio example shows how DSPy signatures need explicit constraints to prevent real-world data leakage.

### Linter Limitations
DOC502 rule doesn't understand exception propagation through helpers. Documentation should describe API behavior from user's perspective, not implementation details.

## Next Session Priorities
See `plan.md` for full list. Critical items:
1. Fix market sentiment randomization bug
2. Constrain Portfolio Manager to use only input symbols
3. Add symbol validation to prevent hallucination
4. Final review and PR submission

## Branch Summary
This branch now includes:
- Type transformation support (Node protocol with TIn/TOut)
- Flow builder validation (reachability & duplicates)
- Custom linters for mission-critical compliance
- Documentation improvements and accurate tagline
- Portfolio example safety (with newly discovered bugs to fix)

## Environment Ready
All tests passing, quality checks clean. Ready to fix portfolio bugs in next session.
