# Session Context

## Current State
- **Branch**: `support-state-type-transformations`
- **Location**: `/Users/richard/Developer/github/artificial-sapience/ClearFlow`
- **Status**: Configuration cleanup complete, README modernized

## Latest Changes (This Session)

### 1. Type Checker Cleanup ✅
- **Removed mypy configuration** from `pyproject.toml`
- Deleted `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` sections completely
- Pyright remains as sole type checker (better PEP 695 support)

### 2. CI Workflow Alignment ✅
- **Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`** to match `quality-check.sh` exactly:
  - Renamed job: `lint-and-type-check` → `quality-checks`
  - Added custom linters that run first (architecture, immutability, test suite)
  - Added complexity checks: Xenon, Vulture, Radon
  - Fixed directories: now checks `clearflow tests examples linters`
  - Removed mypy step completely
  - Added `PYRIGHT_PYTHON_FORCE_VERSION=latest`
- **Security checks updated**:
  - Uses pip-audit with PYSEC-2022-42969 ignored
  - Bandit checks `clearflow examples linters` (excludes tests)

### 3. README Modernization ✅
- **Replaced toy quickstart with RAG Pipeline**:
  - Uses `Query` → `Context` → `Answer` state transformations
  - Shows real AI engineering pattern everyone knows
  - Demonstrates type transformations with `Node[TIn, TOut]`
- **Fixed API usage throughout**:
  - `Flow` → `flow` (function, not class)
  - Added required `name: str` field to all node examples
  - Used frozen dataclasses consistently
- **Added Agent Router example**: Shows branching with multiple agents
- **Updated testing example**: Proper pytest patterns with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`
- **Corrected technical details**:
  - Line count: 166 → ~250 (accurate)
  - API surface: `Node`, `NodeResult`, `flow` (not `Flow`)

## File Status Summary

### Modified Files
- `pyproject.toml` - mypy sections removed
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - complete alignment with quality-check.sh  
- `README.md` - meaningful examples with correct API
- Other workflows - checked but unchanged (no mypy refs)

### Quality Verification
- RAG quickstart example tested and working
- Agent router example verified
- All code blocks use correct API patterns

## Next Session Priorities
See `plan.md` for detailed tasks:
1. Run full `./quality-check.sh` to verify everything passes
2. Review `git diff` for unintended changes
3. Create and submit PR with comprehensive description
